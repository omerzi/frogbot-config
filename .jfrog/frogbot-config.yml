# JFrog Frogbot Config file supports multiple repository configuration.
# It is important to note that 'scan-pull-request' and 'create-fix-pull-request' only work on a single repository, thus only the first repository in the configuration file will be used.
# Please use 'scan-pull-requests' command to apply the multiple repository configurations.
